5. Philip helped me with the navigation bar (seperating the hamburgar menu and the car) also with putting the "main" products in the center of the page.

## Eindgesprek (week 7/8)

So i started all over again ,for the third time, it felt like iwas making it from bottom up instead of starting at the top and going to the bottom. 
What went wrong:
- The navigation bar took so long, i wasn't expecting to give it so much time
- i wanted to make it into a grid layout, but i ended up using flexbox
What went good:
- the site came out the way i wanted it, its responsive the way i wanted it to be.

## Voortgang 2 (week 5)

-At this point i'm very frustrated, it seems like i forgot how to code all together i need to basically re-learn how to code, im scared i wont finish it for next week, and that motivating,i'm also lacking physical help-

## Voortgang 1 (week 3)

### Stand van zaken

-This week started up good, i understood what i wanted to do for the site, im very perticulair and i want it to look good.
so i keep dweling on the wrong things so its going slow-
